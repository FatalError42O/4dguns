VFX, SFX:
    ~Bullet hit node FX (steal mostly from 3dguns)
    Bullet fly-by SFX
    HUD system (most can once again be pulled from 3dguns)
        reload progress
        ammunition left
        ammo type
    player model & gun model reading
    gun sounds

gun features
    firemodes
    gun ammo:
        fractional reloading
        magless flat reload
    "3d" optics
    attachments (last before beta)
    fix shooting through walls while pressing against them
    correct player look-down
    gun leaning
    add hip and aim bone offsets (this is for guns or modifiers that add stuff like "laser sights" or hud that simulates holographic sights, could be cool for futuristic type shooters)
    movement rotation
    sprite scopes: fix player aim delay being present with sprite scopes
bullets
    bullet class system
        add blunt force properties
        on_hitnode function callback

compatibility
    add consts for player inv use in Ammo_handler (i.e. "main", "craft_inv")
    make monoid or use for player properties, player look offsets (especially needed for vehicle mods)
    possibly make a library for overriding core functions.

optimization
    hardcore optimization of get_dir() type functions required- super inefficient.
    optimization of sprite scopes needed, buffering for relative dirs needed for when inactive. Potentially remove the global table for them (if possible.)

auxillary (beta+/never)
    player hitboxes
    server to client lag prediction
    possible user CSM for lag prediction
    bullet drop (maybe bullet wind?)
    bullet tracers
    inverse kinematics
    stamina
    a better system for reloading magazine (something like a inventory that fractionally reloads magazines so it takes time.)
    create a non-player gun API
    bullets, mags: add meta data support? (probably not)
    jamming
