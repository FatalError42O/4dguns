--- defines a sound.

-- however has the following changed or guns4d specific parameters.
-- @field min_hear_distance this is useful if you wish to play a sound which has a "far" sound, such as distant gunshots. incompatible `with to_player`
-- @field sounds a @{misc_helpers.weighted_randoms| weighted_randoms table} for randomly selecting sounds. The output will overwrite the `sound` field.
-- @field to_player 4dguns changes `to_player` so it only plays positionless audio (as it is only intended for first person audio). If set to string "from_player" and player present
-- @field player this is so to_player being set to "from_player". It's to be set to the player which fired the weapon.
-- @field delay delay the playing of the sound
-- @field has_speed_of_sound = true
-- @table guns4d_soundspec

--- allows you to play one or more sounds with more complex features, so sounds can be easily coded for guns without the need for functions.
-- WARNING: this function modifies the tables passed to it, use `Guns4d.table.shallow_copy()` for guns4d_soundspecs
-- @param sound_specs a @{guns4d_soundspec} or a list of @{guns4d_soundspec}s indexed my number. Also allows for shared fields. Example:
--      {
--          to_player = "singeplayer",
--          min_distance = 100, --soundspec_to_play1 & soundspec_to_play2 share this parameter (as well as the to_player)
--          soundspec_to_play1,
--          soundspec_to_play2
--      }
