( ) add audio
( ) add config
(x) fix crash when switching from a gun into a gun with a sprite_scope
(x) add infinite ammo privelage and quick command
    ( ) privilege not directly tied to infinite ammo, fix without breaking performance?
(x) fix animation rotation offset not displaying the correct frame
    -was a problem with MTUL, changes push :D
( ) add entity scopes (for holo sights etc)
( ) add attachments
( ) add other reloading types
    (x) magazine
    ( ) fractional
    ( ) flat (magless)
    ( ) fractional clip
( ) (for 5.9) make infinite ammo priv to rely on on_grant and on_revoke callback for runtime changes (broken as of 5.8)
( ) (5.9) POTENTIALLY make models use new PR that allows bone offsets to be disabled
    -I'd probably have to modify models at loadtime to have an eye and hipfire bone? Probably easier then current system though.
( ) Fix HORRIBLE namespace violation in misc_helpers.lua. Also migrate features to MTUL libraries

this won't be fun.
