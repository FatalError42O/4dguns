( ) allow unloading magazines
( ) fix issue with arm animations being super choppy? (investigation needed)
( ) have breathing act as a multiplier for sway
( ) fix water/fluids
( ) add random deviation
    ( ) randomness system
    ( ) patterns?
    ( ) bloom
(x) add audio
    soundeffects system implemented!
    (x) sfx system
        (x) did signifficant work on it
    ( ) dry fire sound
    (~) reload sound effects
        (x) everything else
        ( ) bolt-catch releasing click
    (x) firemode sound effects
    ( ) firemode switching sound
(~) add config
    (x) add a table for config storage, some settings
    ( ) integrate with minetest settings
(x) fix crash when switching from a gun into a gun with a sprite_scope
(x) add infinite ammo privelage and quick command
    (x) privilege not directly tied to infinite ammo, fix without breaking performance?
(x) fix animation rotation offset not displaying the correct frame
( ) add third idle animation for loaded with magazine but chamber empty
    ( ) use newly implemented bolt catch support
( ) add entity scopes (for holo sights etc)
( ) add attachments
(~) add other reloading types
    (x) magazine
    ( ) fractional
    ( ) flat (magless)
    ( ) fractional with clip
(~) item visuals

    (~) magazine
        (x) unloads in correct position? (sort of, rotation is like impossible to do.)
        ( ) realistic

    ( ) gun
        ( ) realistic
        ( ) arcade/default
(x) fix uncharge gun after incomplete reload, make special pull out animation only play for first charge
(x) make reloads "automatic" (press/hold z once, and again to cancel)
    (x) add control system
    (x) implement for reload (may not be needed if first step done correctly)
( ) (for 5.9) make infinite ammo priv to rely on on_grant and on_revoke callback for runtime changes (cannot be done as broken in 5.8)
( ) (5.9) POTENTIALLY make models use new PR that allows bone offsets to be disabled
    -I'd probably have to modify models at loadtime to have an eye and hipfire bone? Probably easier then current system though.
(x) Fix HORRIBLE namespace violation in misc_helpers.lua. Also migrate features to MTUL libraries

this won't be fun.
